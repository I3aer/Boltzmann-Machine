# Boltzmann-Machine

Boltzmann machine to solve the data association problem. BM is a symetrically interconnected network
of neuron-like units. Those units make stochastic decisions whether to be on or off . This means that 
the Boltzmann machine accepts or rejects the elemental hypotheses represented by their units at each 
iteration. The aim of the Boltzmann machine is to find probable configuration of units by minimizing 
an energy function. Thus, it will have a stationary distribution which is equal to the distribution 
over valid joint association events. To this end, the Boltzmann machine uses the simulated annealing 
schedule. The Boltzmann machines are stacked to form a parallel computational organization. This leads 
to the computationally efficient and accurate solutions to constraint satisfaction tasks.
